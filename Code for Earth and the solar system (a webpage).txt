<p><br><strong>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the
only astronomical object known to harbor life.
While large volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar
System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water. About 71% of
Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's
polar ice, lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29% of Earth's
surface is land, consisting of continents
and islands.</strong></p>

<h2>About the solar system</h2>

<p><strong>The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system
of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. It formed 4.6 billion
years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar
molecular cloud.</strong> The four inner system planets—<strong>
Mercury, Venus,Earth and Mars</strong>—are terrestrial planets, being
composed primarily of rock and metal. The four giant planets of
the outer system are substantially larger and more massive than
the terrestrials.The two largest, </strong>Jupiter and Saturn</strong>,
are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the next two,
<strong>Uranus and Neptune<strong>, are ice giants, being composed mostly of volatile
substances with relatively high melting points compared with
hydrogen and helium, such as water, ammonia, and methane.
<strong>All eight planets have nearly circular orbits that lie near the
plane of Earth's orbit, called the ecliptic.</strong> </p>
